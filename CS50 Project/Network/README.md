Where to compile the website? How to compile the website?
Go to you favorite IDE (CS50 IDE is suggested). Make sure you have (and otherwise pip install) the
following modules: cs50, flask, flask-session, flask_Mail, datetime, tempfile, werkzeug, re. Then,
"cd" into the "Network" folder. Then enter 'flask run' on the command line. Click on the address
shown on the command line.

How to use the project?
If you haven't created an account, click on register on the upper right corner. Enter your first name,
username, and password. You are taken to the home page. You see three circles: "My Friends", "Add a
friend", and "Reach out now!". Since you just registered you don't have listed friends yet, so let's
add a friend: click on "Add a friend" circle. You will see a form asking for some information about your
friend. Enter the required information on the form: friend's name, friend's email, friend's favorite anything,
where you met your friend. You will also see three dropdown menus: one for the priority level of your friend,
another for the nature of your relationship with this friend, and another with the desired frequency to reach
out to this friend (I would advise to select "Every 1 minute" so that you can see how the website works faster).
After entering all this information, click "Add".


After clicking "Add", you are taken to a page where you can see a list of all your friends (you could also access
this page by clicking "All Friends" on the upper bar).

Click "Reach out now!" on the upper bar. This will take you to a list of all friends you have to reach out to.
At this point, you probably don't see anything yet. You have to wait until the reachout frequency that you entered
has elapsed (this is why I suggest to try this with a 1 minute frequency first).

After the frequency has elapsed, you will see the name of your friend on the list appear automatically. Friends of
high priority will always be on the top of the list and will be colored with red. Friends of low priority will be at
the bottom of the list and will be colored with blue.

Click on the friend that just popped up on the list. You will see a vertical menu that contains different information
you entered about your friend. You can click on any option to have a piece of information displayed. You can click on
"Some news on what they love" and you will see some news on what your friend likes - in case you need to run out of
what to say in a conversation!

Now, click on "All Friends" at the top of the bar. You will see that there is a popup notification in this list. Basically,
if you don't want to go to "Reach Out Now!" and you prefer to stay on the "All Friends" page, you will get a notification
every time the reachout frequency has elapsed.

Click on the name of the friend you entered (on the popup notification). This will take you back to the page containing
specific information on your friend.

To reach out to your friend, click on "Reach Out by Automatic Email". This will take you back to the list of friends you have
to reach out to. Note that the name of that friend is no longer on this list. Also, when you clicked on "reach out by automatic
email", an email was sent to your friend's email address from a bot. The email will basically say hi to the friend.

You can also sort friends by the types of friends. Click on "Sort Friends" on the top of the page. Select a type of relationship.
You will see a list containing all the friends that have the type of relationship you selected.

Now, you can click on "Log Out" on the upper right corner.
